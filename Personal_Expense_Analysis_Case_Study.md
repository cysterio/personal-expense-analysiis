# Personal Expense Analysis – Case Study

## Problem Statement
The objective was to analyze personal spending data to understand expense patterns, identify budget risks, and provide actionable financial insights.

## Dataset
The dataset consisted of daily expense records including date, category, amount spent, and payment mode over a short time window.

## Approach
- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand spending frequency and cost distribution.
- Conducted category-wise and time-based analysis to identify dominant spending drivers.
- Defined a hypothetical monthly budget to evaluate budget compliance.
- Built dashboard-style KPIs to summarize financial health.
- Estimated future spending using average daily expenditure.

## Key Findings
- Total spending amounted to ₹3589 against a budget of ₹5000, indicating overall budget compliance.
- Shopping dominated expenses, contributing ₹1900 (≈53%) of total spending.
- Average daily spending was approximately ₹598, representing the daily burn rate.
- Shopping was identified as the primary financial risk due to its disproportionate contribution.

## Recommendations
- Reduce the frequency of shopping-related purchases to control discretionary spending.
- Set category-level spending caps for non-essential expenses.
- Monitor daily expenses to prevent unnoticed budget creep.

## Outcome
The analysis demonstrated how data-driven insights can identify financial risks even when overall spending remains within budget, highlighting the importance of category-level monitoring over total expenditure alone.
